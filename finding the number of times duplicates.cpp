     ðŸŽ¯ EXPLANATION OF LOGIC
     ðŸ”¹ Goal: Count how many times each duplicate element appears.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Use `i` to traverse the array.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 2: When we find `a[i] == a[i+1]`, it means duplicates start.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Introduce `j = i + 1` to count how long the duplicate sequence continues.
                - While `a[j] == a[i]`, increment `j`.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 4: At this point:
                - `j` points to the first unique element after duplicates.
                - The count of duplicates = `j - i`.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Print result â†’ element `a[i]` appears `(j - i)` times.
     ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Update `i = j - 1` so that next iteration starts fresh
                after the duplicates (avoiding re-checking them).
     ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
        - The `while` loop only advances `j` forward without resetting.
        - So overall, each element is checked once â†’ O(n).
     âœ… Example Walkthrough:
        Array = {3, 6, 8, 8, 10, 12, 15, 15, 15, 20}
        âž¡ i=2 â†’ a[i]=8, a[i+1]=8 â†’ duplicate found.
           j runs until j=4 â†’ stops at 10.
           Count = j-i = 4-2 = 2 â†’ "8 is appearing 2 times".
           Then i = j-1 = 3 â†’ loop continues.
        âž¡ i=6 â†’ a[i]=15, a[i+1]=15 â†’ duplicate found.
           j runs until j=9 â†’ stops at 20.
           Count = j-i = 9-6 = 3 â†’ "15 is appearing 3 times".
           Then i = j-1 = 8 â†’ loop continues.
        âž¡ Output â†’ Correctly prints counts of duplicates only once.
